# Store Background
A retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer info, product categories, order times, and order status. The business wants to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and increase profitability using data-driven decisions.

# Problem Statement
The store doesn’t have a clear idea about:

1. which products sell the most,
2. customers preference,
3. which items bring in the most profit, and
4. where things are going wrong in delivery or operations.
Because of this, they are missing chances to earn more, losing customers, and making poor business decisions.

# Solution
They need proper reports and simple insights to understand their sales, customers, and product performance better.

That’s the complete text content.

Do you want me to combine this with the Store Background text you shared earlier into a clean, structured summary (almost like a business case document) so you can use it directly for analysis or presentation?
